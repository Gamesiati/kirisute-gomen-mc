## Server-side mods/datapacks that affect gameplay

### Mods
* Crops Love Rain  
Crops grow faster in rain.  
* Geophilic  
Subtle-ish overhaul of vanilla Overworld biomes.  
* Geyser and Floodgate  
Allows Bedrock players to join the Java server. Java mechanics are used, and some minor bugs occur for Bedrock users.  
* NetherPortalFix  
* RightClickHarvest  
(Java only) Right click to harvest crops and replant them. Using a hoe covers a larger area.  
* Unloaded Activity  
When online but far away enough from simulated entities (e.g. crops or furnaces), those entities won't continue their actions.  
This mod simulates the time the player is away and updates the entities accordingly.  

### Datapacks
* Dynamic Lights  
Torches and lanterns emit an actual light source visible to everyone, which can also prevent mob spawning in the vicinity.  
Light emissions are also available from:
    * Burning entities
    * Entities with the glowing potion effect
    * Ghasts about to shoot a fireball
    * Enchanted items
    * Armor trimmed with amethyst
    * Items enchanted with Fire Aspect
    * Tridents enchanted with Riptide inside water
    * Tridents enchanted with Channeling during a thunderstorm
* Veinminer and Veinminer Enchantment  
Allows mining a single ore to break the full vein of the same ore.
Limited to tools enchanted with it.

## Known Geyser Issues
* Stripping logs does not work when holding a shield in the off-hand.  
* When using a stonecutter, shift-clicking does not work and requires single uses.
